# NIST-CSF
NIST CyberSecurity Framework management tool

This excel document provides a visual view of the NIST CyberSecurity Framework (CSF), adding in additional 
fields to track management to the framework.

The workbook has 3 main sheets, the first 2 are instructional and can be removed once one is comfortable with the tool. 
The 3rd sheet has demo-data, which can be replaced with actual data from an organization.

Key components of this tool: 
 - Track the CSF controls individually
 - Track solutions used to meet the controls via a service catalog
 - Track budgetary requests to improve or maintain controls
 - Document current maturity in each control and maturity goals, using the CMMI model
 - Track a 3-5 year plan, tracking projects and recurring functions

There are currently 2 versions of the spreadsheet, listed as 2016 and 2017. The 2016 model is simpler, where the 2017 model 
intends to provide better usability and management.

Users can modify the tool to support alternate maturity models (ex: CSF recommends tiers). Users can update with the CSF v1.1 
update when finalized (adding in 3rd party governance). All data is fictitious and is represented as an example. Please update
to reflect actual service catalog products and solutions, as well as, actual maturity and projects.
